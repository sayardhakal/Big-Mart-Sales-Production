# Big-Mart-Sales-Production
In this project, I have build a big mart sales production using python machine learning. I have used XGBoost Regressor for model training.The dataset used in this project is taken from kaggle(https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/brijbhushannanda1979/bigmart-sales-data?select=Train.csv).From this project, one can learn about data handling, label encoder etc. Overall process for this project are:
1. Data collection 
2. Pre-processing
3. Data analysis
4. Train test split
5. Model training
6. Model evaluation
